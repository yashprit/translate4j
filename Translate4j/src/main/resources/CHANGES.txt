== Version 1.0.1 ==

* Removed obsolete test key 
  
* Changed regular expression that checks API key so that it accepts underscores

== Version 1.0.0 ==

Initial release.

* Basque language is not supported, this is a Google issue.
  The library itself can handle it and will support it when
  Google adds support to it. 
  
* Translation from a language to iself is also not supported.
  Again this is a Google issue and when fixed the library will
  automatically support it.
